## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. WebRTC Connection Failed
**Symptoms:** Voice sessions don't start, connection timeout
**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check TURN server configuration
railway variables get | grep TURN

# Verify firewall settings
curl -I https://yourapp.railway.app/webrtc/offer

# Test with different browsers
# Chrome DevTools > Console for WebRTC errors
```

#### 2. Gemini API Errors
**Symptoms:** Chat responses fail, quota exceeded errors
**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check API key validity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
  https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/models

# Monitor quota usage
railway logs --filter "quota"

# Implement retry logic (already included)
```

#### 3. Audio Quality Issues
**Symptoms:** Choppy audio, high latency, connection drops
**Solutions:**
```env
# Optimize audio settings
AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE=16000  # Lower for better performance
AUDIO_CHANNELS=1
ENABLE_NOISE_SUPPRESSION=true

# Adjust WebRTC settings
MAX_BITRATE=64000
PACKET_LOSS_TOLERANCE=0.05
```

#### 4. High Resource Usage
**Symptoms:** Slow responses, memory warnings
**Solutions:**
```bash
# Scale up resources
railway up --memory 2GB --cpu 2

# Optimize worker configuration
railway variables set WORKERS=1
railway variables set MAX_WORKER_CONNECTIONS=500
```

### Debug Mode
```env
# Enable debug logging
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
DEBUG=true
ENABLE_DOCS=true
```

## üìä Scaling and Performance

### Horizontal Scaling
```toml
# railway.toml
[deploy.replicas]
min = 1
max = 5

[deploy.autoscaling]
enabled = true
target_cpu = 70
target_memory = 80
```

### Load Balancing
Railway automatically handles load balancing, but consider:
- **Session affinity** for WebRTC connections
- **Health check optimization** for faster failover
- **Geographic distribution** for global users

### Cost Optimization
```bash
# Monitor usage
railway metrics

# Optimize resource allocation
railway variables set WORKERS=1  # Single worker for WebRTC state
railway variables set KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT=5  # Faster connection cleanup
```

## üîê Security Best Practices

### API Key Security
```bash
# Rotate API keys regularly
railway variables set GEMINI_API_KEY="new_key_here"

# Use Railway's secret management
railway variables set --secret GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key"
```

### Network Security
```env
# Restrict CORS origins
CORS_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com"

# Enable rate limiting
MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_IP=10
MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=60
```

### Data Protection
```env
# Enable encryption
ENCRYPT_SESSIONS=true
SESSION_TIMEOUT=3600

# Audit logging
ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGS=true
LOG_PERSONAL_DATA=false
```
